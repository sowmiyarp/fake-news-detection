# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify news content
as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual information.

## Overview
Fake news detection is a critical problem in today’s digital era. This project
applies NLP techniques and machine learning models to analyze news articles and
predict their authenticity.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Fake news classification

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of fake and real news articles.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full dataset is **not included** in this
repository. Users can reproduce the results by using publicly available fake news
datasets or by providing their own dataset in the same format.


## Project Status
The project is implemented and tested locally. Future improvements may include
deployment and further model optimization.
