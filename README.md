# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify news content
as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual information.

## Overview
Fake news detection is a critical problem in today’s digital era. This project
applies NLP techniques and traditional machine learning models to analyze news
articles and predict their authenticity based on textual patterns.

The application is intended as a **learning and demonstration project** to
showcase the end-to-end workflow of an NLP-based ML system.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit  

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Interactive fake news classification using a web interface

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of fake and real news articles.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full dataset is **not included** in this
repository. Users can reproduce the results by using publicly available fake news
datasets or by providing their own dataset in the same format.

## Limitations
- The model performs **better on news articles similar to the training data**
- Predictions may be **inconsistent for very short, informal, or unseen news styles**
- The application is **not intended for real-world fact verification**, but for
  educational and experimental purposes

## Project Status
 **Experimental / Learning Project**

The project is successfully implemented and deployed using Streamlit.
It works correctly for many inputs but may not generalize well to all types of
news content. Future improvements may include enhanced preprocessing,
larger datasets, advanced models, and improved generalization.
